              <p>No-A flexible ticket doesn’t guarantee you’ll be able to change to exactly the travel time or date you want. Any changes still depend on availability e.g whether there is space on the ferry you’d prefer.</p>

              <summary><strong>What happens if the ferry is full?</strong></summary>
