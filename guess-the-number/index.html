    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Is Guess the Number free to play?</h3>
    <p>Yes — it’s completely free to play in your browser with no sign-up required.</p>

    <h3>Does the game store or share my data?</h3>
    <p>No personal data is collected or shared. Any game stats are stored privately on your own device.</p>

    <h3>Why didn’t my guess count?</h3>
    <p>If your guess is invalid (blank / not a number) or outside the current range, it won’t count. This keeps the game fair.</p>

    <h3>How does the difficulty level work?</h3>
    <p>Level Up and Level Down change the number range and the guess limit. Changing the level restarts the game with a new random number.</p>

    <h3>Is this game suitable for children?</h3>
    <p>Yes — it’s designed to be safe, simple, and suitable for children, while still being fun for adults too.</p>
