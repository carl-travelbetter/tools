          <h3>Timers and Countdowns</h3>
          <p>Managing time is an essential skill for effective travel but can be a real challenge for Neurodivergent families. </p>
          <p>For example, a number of Neurdivergent people can be time blind and really struggle with the very basics of keeping on schedule. </p>
          <p>To help with these challenges we have created a number of simple to use countdown and timer apps designed to take the stress out of time management and help you travel better.</p>
